       <h3>IT'S ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND OURS</h3>
		<p> It&#39s estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of homeless dogs and cats wandering the streets of Houston.
		In addition to the suffering homeless animals endure, the costs to our community are staggering. 
        Our mission is to end homelessness and suffering of companion animals and elevate their status in society. We envision a world where companion animals do not suffer and are valued by society.</p>

         <h3> THE PROBLEM IS SOLVABLE.<br>
          AND YOU CAN HELP.
          </h3>
              <p>Through funding from individuals, corporate sponsors and with the cooperation of local governments, we believe the problem of animal homelessness is solvable. Through our Partnerships, Research, Events and Grants, we are already helping tens of thousands of homeless pets avoid being killed every year by placing them in new, loving homes. With your help, we can increase awareness of the problem, encourage our elected officials to get more involved, and most of all, raise the funds needed to protect the animals and solve the problem.</p>

    <h3>LEARN MORE,
    GET INVOLVED.</h3>
           <p>Houston PetSet is fortunate that Girl Scout Haley Benefield selected animal welfare as the focus of her Gold Award. She met with members of the Houston PetSet team to learn about the region&#58s overpopulation issue and how transport is one tool to help homeless animals by finding them loving homes in areas of the country where there are shortages of adoptable pets. Her informative video helps to educate viewers about transport, and hopefully, will inspire them to get involved in supporting local animal welfare efforts. Learn more and how you can get involved by watching her video.</p>
